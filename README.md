2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed
3. Set up your GitHub credentials:
   - Configure your Git username and email

# Daily Inspiration and Activity Tracker

This tool generates daily inspirational quotes and tracks your development activities. It helps maintain a log of your daily progress while keeping you motivated with meaningful quotes.

## How it Works

The `auto_commit.py` script:
- Creates/updates a `daily_update.txt` file with timestamps and inspirational quotes
- Tracks your development activities and progress
- Maintains a historical record of your journey

## Automated Daily Runs

To run the quote generator automatically every day:

### On Windows:
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create a new task to run `python auto_commit.py` daily
3. Set the working directory to your repository location

## Note

Make sure to:
- Keep your local repository updated
- Maintain proper credentials
- Check the logs periodically to ensure the quote generator is running correctly
